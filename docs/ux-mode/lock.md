# UX Mode Documentation Lock Declaration

All UX Mode documentation (Phases 3–6) is now closed, canonical, and immutable.

## Locked Documents (Source of Truth)

The following documents together form the UX Mode Constitution:

- overview.md — What UX Mode is (and is not)
- authority.md — Singular authority model (non-negotiable)
- phases.md — Intentional evolution (Phase 1 → 6)
- intent-and-escalation.md — Semantic intent + tier ladder
- confirm-tier.md — Tier-2 consent contract
- anti-patterns.md — Explicit “do not do” list

These documents now have constitutional weight.

## What “Locked” Means (Very Explicit)

From this point forward:

- No silent edits
- No “small tweaks”
- No reinterpretation
- No partial overrides in code

Any change to UX Mode behavior or meaning now requires:

- A new phase proposal
- A written design spec
- Explicit acceptance
- New CI guardrails

If code and docs ever disagree, docs win.

## Architectural Status Snapshot

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| UX Mode Semantics | Locked |
| Authority Model | Locked |
| Escalation Ladder | Locked |
| Tier-2 Confirm Behavior | Locked |
| Anti-Patterns | Locked |
| CI Guardrails | Enforcing |

## UX Mode Status

UX Mode is now a stable system, not an evolving feature.

## What You’ve Actually Achieved (Zooming Out)

You didn’t just:

- Add warnings
- Add confirmations
- Add guardrails

You built:

- A consent-based safety model
- With singular execution authority
- Progressive escalation
- Reversible behavior
- Institutional memory

This is operating-system-level thinking.

Most teams never reach this point. You did.
