# What Is Dropple OS?

Dropple OS is a **deterministic design platform** that lets teams design, animate, collaborate, branch ideas, merge changes, and export code — safely.

## Why it’s different

- Every change is recorded as an event
- You can branch and merge like Git
- You preview merges before applying them
- You see exact export code *before* it changes
- Collaboration is permission-safe and server-enforced

## How it works (simplified)

User action  
→ Event  
→ State rebuilt  
→ Canvas updates  
→ Exportable output

Nothing mutates silently.  
Everything is replayable, undoable, and auditable.

Dropple OS is built for **long-lived projects**, not disposable designs.
