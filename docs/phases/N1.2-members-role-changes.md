# N1.2 — Members List + Role Changes (Design Spec)

## Scope (Locked)

N1.2 adds administrative membership controls only.

### N1.2 Includes

- Owner-only members list
- Role changes (editor ⇄ viewer)
- Remove member access

### N1.2 Does Not Include

- Presence, cursors, intent, or live collaboration
- Shared undo or concurrent editing
- Public sharing or link-based access
- Email notifications
- Team/organization features

## Data Model (No New Tables)

Uses existing tables only:

- `documentMembers`
- `documentInvites`

## Server Contracts (Preview)

### Queries

- `listDocumentMembers(docId)` (owner-only)
  - Returns: `userId`, `role`, `createdAt`

### Mutations

- `updateMemberRole(docId, userId, role)` (owner-only)
  - Allowed: editor ⇄ viewer
  - Forbidden: changing owner role
- `removeMember(docId, userId)` (owner-only)
  - Forbidden: removing owner

## UI Placement (Locked)

Sharing panel only:

- Renders only for owners
- Renders only for persisted docs
- Appears below Invites section

No separate panel or modal.

## UX Rules (Phase 6 Alignment)

- No empty states or instructional UI
- Inline actions only (no modals required)
- Clear verbs: "Change role", "Remove access"
- No implication of live collaboration

## Completion Checklist

- Owner sees member list for saved docs
- Owner can change editor ⇄ viewer
- Owner cannot demote/remove self
- Editors/viewers never see the panel
- Role changes apply immediately
- No runtime/editor behavior changes
